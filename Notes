  u declare the "hasOne or belong to....etc" in the model file
  but u gotta add the key and refrences manually to the migration file then run the migrations


sequelize migration:create --name add-email-to-user

check Optimistic Locking
SELECT*FROM tablename;

Raw queries
Sometimes you might be expecting a massive dataset that you just want to display, without manipulation. For each row you select, Sequelize creates an instance with functions for update, delete, get associations etc. If you have thousands of rows, this might take some time. If you only need the raw data and don't want to update anything, you can do like this to get the raw data.

// Are you expecting a massive dataset from the DB,
// and don't want to spend the time building DAOs for each entry?
// You can pass an extra query option to get the raw data instead:
Project.findAll({ where: { ... }, raw: true })


const Post = sequelize.define('post', attributes, {
  defaultScope: {
    where: {
      active: true
    }
  },
  scopes: {
    deleted: {
      where: {
        deleted: true
      }
    }
  }
});

User.hasMany(Post); // regular getPosts association
User.hasMany(Post.scope('deleted'), { as: 'deletedPosts' });
User.getPosts(); // WHERE active = true
User.getDeletedPosts(); // WHERE deleted = true
